A 32nd elevator pitch, sometimes called your 32nd commercial, is a quick way to introduce yourself at a career fair when networking or in any professional setting. Start off with a quick intro, your name, year in school, and major. Next, mention your plans for the future. What field are you interested in? Let the other person know your goals. Then talk about the steps you've taken to get there. Briefly describe your experience or skills that you've developed to help you reach your career goal. Finally, if you're talking to an employer, mention how their company fits into your career plan. And there you have it, the 32nd elevator pitch. Create one and you'll be able to approach employers with confidence. So what's your pitch?
