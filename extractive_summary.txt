Our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes or in their offices. These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed. Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings. But they cannot touch the foundation of America. But they cannot dent the steel of American resolve. America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. Today our nation saw evil. The very worst of human nature. And we responded with the best of America. Federal agencies in Washington, which had to be evacuated today, are reopening for essential personnel tonight and will be open for business tomorrow. America and our friends and allies join with all those who want peace and security in the world. And we stand together to win the war against terrorism. This is a day when all Americans from every walk of life, unite in our resolve for justice and peace.
