A 32nd elevator pitch is a quick way to introduce yourself at a career fair or in any professional setting. It includes a quick introduction, your name, year in school, and major, followed by your plans for the future, the steps you've taken to get there, and how your company fits into your career plan. It is important to create a 32nd elevator pitch to help you approach employers with confidence.
