The United States government has responded to the recent terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington DC by implementing emergency response plans. The first priority is to get help to those injured and to protect citizens from further attacks. The search is underway for those responsible and the full resources of the intelligence and law enforcement communities are being directed to find them and bring them to justice. The president thanks members of Congress and world leaders for their condolences and assistance. He asks for prayers for those who grieve and for those whose sense of safety and security has been threatened. America has stood down any enemies before and will do so this time.
